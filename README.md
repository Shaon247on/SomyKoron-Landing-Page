## 🚀 About Me
I'm Aminul Islam Shaon, a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Firebase and React.js, and backend technologies like Node.js, MongoDB and Ecpress.js. I have hands-on experience building dynamic and user-friendly web applications, focusing on both frontend and backend development. From creating visually appealing interfaces with Tailwind CSS to ensuring smooth server-side functionality with Express.js, I enjoy every step of the development process.


## Concept 💡

This project is a replication of the landing page from Mona AI, assigned as a job task by the recruiter. The goal was to closely match the design and functionality of the original site using React, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS within a 48-hour timeframe.


## Features ✨

- Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- Tailwind CSS: Utilized for efficient styling and maintaining consistency with the original design.
- React Components: The page is built with React, utilizing reusable components to maintain modularity and efficiency.
